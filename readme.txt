These files implement the ground motion simulation procedure proposed in the following documents:

Yamamoto, Y., and Baker, J. W. (2013). “Stochastic model for earthquake ground motion using wavelet packets.” Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 103(6), 3044–3056.

Yamamoto, Y. (2011). Stochastic model for earthquake ground motion using wavelet packets. Ph.D. Thesis. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA. 295p.



The following files are included:

regress_2stage_doc.pdf:  Two-stage regression analysis documentation. Results from the regression analyses used to develop the predictive models. Many more details and intermediate results are provided here than there is room for in other publications

regress_MixedEffect_doc.pdf:  Mixed-effects regression analysis documentation. Alternate results obtained using mixed-effects regression analyses to develop the predictive models, instead of two-stage regression.

GroudMotionRecordingList.pdf:  List of ground motions used. Ground motions used to calibrate the model, and a few details about each motion.

Matlab scripts: a set of scripts and functions used in the simulation procedure. Start with main_sgm.m
